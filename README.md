# Project Status: Backend & Frontend Integration (Admin Section)

This document outlines the current status of the project, detailing the completed tasks and the planned next steps.

## Done (Completed Tasks)

### Backend Development

*   **NestJS Application Initialized:** A new NestJS project (`backend`) has been created from scratch.
*   **Prisma ORM Integrated:** Prisma has been set up as the ORM, including `prisma-client-js` generation.
*   **PostgreSQL Database Configured:** The `newd` PostgreSQL database is configured and connected via Prisma.
*   **Database Schema Defined:** The `prisma/schema.prisma` file has been populated with the following models and their relationships, based on frontend analysis:
    *   `Manager`
    *   `Equipe`
    *   `Commercial`
    *   `Zone`
    *   `Immeuble`
    *   `Porte`
    *   Associated Enums (`ImmeubleStatus`, `ProspectingMode`, `PorteStatut`, `AssignmentType`)
*   **Database Migrations & Seeding:**
    *   The database schema has been successfully applied to `newd` using `prisma db push`.
    *   A `prisma/seed.ts` script has been created and successfully executed to populate the database with sample data for all core entities.
*   **CRUD Endpoints Implemented:**
    *   Dedicated NestJS modules, controllers, and services have been created for `Manager`, `Equipe`, `Commercial`, `Zone`, `Immeuble`, and `Porte`.
    *   Basic CRUD (Create, Read All, Read One, Update, Delete) endpoints are functional for all these entities.
*   **Basic Statistics Module:** A `StatisticsModule` has been set up in the backend with a controller and service, ready to receive requests for statistical data (currently returns mock data).

### Frontend Integration

*   **Service Layer Created:** A `front/src/services` directory has been created, housing new service files (`manager.service.ts`, `equipe.service.ts`, `commercial.service.ts`, `zone.service.ts`, `immeuble.service.ts`, `porte.service.ts`, `statistics.service.ts`).
*   **API Client Setup:** A base `api.ts` file has been created for Axios, configured to connect to the backend (defaulting to `http://localhost:3000`).
*   **Admin Pages Updated:** All relevant admin pages (`ManagersPage.tsx`, `ManagerDetailsPage.tsx`, `EquipesPage.tsx`, `EquipeDetailsPage.tsx`, `CommerciauxPage.tsx`, `CommercialDetailsPage.tsx`, `ZonesPage.tsx`, `ImmeublesPage.tsx`, `ImmeubleDetailsPage.tsx`, `DashboardAdmin.tsx`, `StatistiquesPage.tsx`) have been modified to consume data from the new backend services instead of mock data.

### Verification

*   **Backend CRUD Verification:** Basic CRUD operations for all implemented entities were verified using `curl` commands. `GET` and `PATCH` operations were successful across the board. `DELETE` operations for `Manager`, `Equipe`, `Zone`, and `Immeuble` failed as expected due to existing foreign key constraints (e.g., a manager cannot be deleted if associated with an equipe).

## Next Steps (To Be Done)

### Backend

*   **Implement Statistics Logic:** Develop the actual data aggregation and calculation logic within `StatisticsService` to replace the current mock data with real-time statistics from the database. This will involve complex Prisma queries to generate KPIs, leaderboards, historical data, and performance metrics.
*   **Authentication and Authorization:** Implement a robust authentication system (e.g., JWT) and role-based access control (RBAC) for different user types (Admin, Manager, Commercial, Directeur, Backoffice) across all API endpoints.
*   **Remaining Entities/Features:** Implement backend logic for other entities and features present in the Prisma schema but not yet fully exposed via CRUD or specific business logic (e.g., `RendezVous`, `Contrat`, `Alerte`, `StatPeriod`, `Transcription`).
*   **Error Handling & Validation:** Enhance error handling and input validation for all API endpoints.

### Frontend

*   **Full Backend Integration:** Ensure all frontend components and pages correctly consume and display data from the new backend endpoints, addressing any remaining data formatting or display issues.
*   **Authentication Flow:** Implement the user authentication and authorization flow in the frontend, integrating with the backend's security system.
*   **Real-time Features:** Integrate real-time data updates (e.g., for the `SuiviPage`) if required, potentially using WebSockets.
*   **UI/UX Refinements:** Address any remaining UI/UX adjustments, styling, and responsiveness across the application.

### General

*   **Comprehensive Testing:** Develop and implement unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for both the frontend and backend to ensure stability and correctness.
*   **Deployment Configuration:** Prepare the application for deployment, including environment variable management, Dockerization (if applicable), and CI/CD pipeline setup.
